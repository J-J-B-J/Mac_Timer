# Mac_Timer
 Mac's didn't have a timer... until now!

This project is a timer made for macs (but that probably also works on  PC, I haven't checked) with Pygame!

Simply run the program from your fav python editor, then disconnect the editor from the program.

Use the arrows above and below the numbers to change them, and return to play/pause!

When the timer goes off, it will play two piano notes in quick succession (unless configured otherwise in settings.json) and show a notification!
